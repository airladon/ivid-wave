## What is an Interactive Video?

An interactive video is a video like experience where users can interact with elements in the video.

In this video, users can change diagrams to explore concepts, touch on equations and descriptions to step through their meaning and unlock extra information not in the main storyline.

## How to make Interactive Content

[FigureOne](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/) is a JavaScript library for making animated and interactive figures and equations, but it also supports creating interactive slide shows and interactive videos like this one.

The repository has [tutorials](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/tree/master/docs/tutorials), [examples](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/tree/master/docs/examples) and an [API reference](https://airladon.github.io/FigureOne/api/) that can get you started.

An interactive video is essentially an interactive figure with aligned state transitions and audio. Therefore, it is  best to start with simple interactive figures and build up to videos.
