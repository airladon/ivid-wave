# What is an interactive video?

This is a JavaScript application
An interactive video is an interactive figure or diagram, with many predefined states and an overlaid audio track.



This is an interactive video introducing Waves.

Elements within the video can be touched and moved. Diagrams, buttons and equations can be interactive. Generally, if you see the cursor (blue circle) interacting with an element on the screen, then you can too.

When you do, the video will pause, giving you time to experiment with and hopefully gain an intuition for each concept. Press play to continue, keeping in mind any changes you made will be reset.
